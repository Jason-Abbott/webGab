# webGab
I created webGab as a discussion board to complement other widgets I built and sold, [webCal](https://github.com/Jason-Abbott/webCal), [webNav](https://github.com/Jason-Abbott/webNav) and [webAlbum](https://github.com/Jason-Abbott/webAlbum). It would leverage *Nav* techniques to show a threaded view and *Album* to show photos. I used this on a couple sites but never ended up going to market with it.

# Innovations
- Browser capability detection to use code-generated Javascript in `_js.asp` for threaded view, if supported. 
- Themeable from a set of coordinated palettes with instructions on how to create your own.
